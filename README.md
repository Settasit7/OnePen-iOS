# OnePen: AR krathong (iOS)
OnePen is an application designed to alleviate the environmental problems resulting from Thailand's Loy Krathong Festival.

Instead of releasing a physical krathong into the river, causing water pollution, OnePen guides users step-by-step to make a Thai cultural krathong in 3D, allowing them to design their unique one and see it placed in the real-world environment using AR technology. In AR, users can add or remove as many krathongs as they prefer and freely shift, rotate, or scale any of them to get the best shot. The best thing about this app is users can capture images of krathongs in AR and automatically save them to photos for further use, like posting on social media. With OnePen, people can participate in the Loy Krathong Festival and protect the environment.
